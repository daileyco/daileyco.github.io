[About Me](/about-me/) has a brief of my background. 

[Curriculum Vitae](/cv/cv_dailey_09112020.pdf) has a likely-out-of-date CV. :)

[Journal of Walkthroughs](https://daileyco.github.io/Journal-of-Walkthroughs) contains a variety of blog posts / tutorials that I've developed, mainly, for myself.
