Hello! My name is Cody Dailey. I am an Epidemiology PhD Student in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the College of Public Health at the University of Georgia (UGA).

I am a triple Dawg, meaning that I have applied / been admitted to UGA thrice. I received my Bachelor's of Science (BS) degree in Biology with a minor in French in 2015. I received my Master's of Public Health (MPH) dual degree concentrating in Epidemiology and Biostatistics in 2017. Immediately following my MPH program, I began my PhD program. 

I am also a National Science Foundation Research Trainee with the Interdisciplinary Disease Ecology Across Scales (IDEAS) program in Odum School of Ecology. 

My research interests include infectious diseases, mathematical modeling, surveillance, spatial epidemiology, phylodynamics, and data science among others. 

Currently, I am working to formulate my dissertation which will focus on addressing common sources of bias in epidemiology research using data science perspectives in an application to malaria epidemiology.
