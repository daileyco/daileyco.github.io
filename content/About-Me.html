<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Cody Dailey</strong>. I am an Epidemiology PhD Student in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the College of Public Health at the University of Georgia (UGA).</p>

<p>I am a triple Dawg, meaning that I have applied / been admitted to UGA thrice. I received my Bachelor’s of Science (BS) degree in Biology with a minor in French in 2015. I received my Master’s of Public Health (MPH) dual degree concentrating in Epidemiology and Biostatistics in 2017. Immediately following my MPH program, I began my PhD program.</p>

<p>I am also a National Science Foundation Research Trainee with the Interdisciplinary Disease Ecology Across Scales (IDEAS) program in Odum School of Ecology.</p>
<p>My research interests include infectious diseases, mathematical modeling, surveillance, spatial epidemiology, phylodynamics, and data science among others.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working to formulate my dissertation which will focus on addressing common sources of bias in epidemiology research using data science perspectives in an application to malaria epidemiology.</p>
